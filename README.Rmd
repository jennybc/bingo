# bingo

Generate Bingo cards.

Currently has built-in squares for SuperBowl 50 :football: and data / spreadsheet craziness :chart_with_downwards_trend: and more. Or you can provide your own text for the squares.

Make printable Bingo cards **without installing anything** via this Shiny app:

  * <http://daattali.com/shiny/bingo/>
  * It's also included in the package (see [below](#run-shiny-app-locally)).
  
Feel free to help us make these cards less ugly or to explore new bingo topics! PRs welcome :grin:.

## Installation

Install from GitHub with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jennybc/bingo")
```

## SuperBowl Example

```{r}
library(bingo)

## see some of the SuperBowl 50 squares
tail(topics$football)

## make 8 bingo cards (SuperBowl 50 is current default)
bc <- bingo(8)

## print them to PDF
plot(bc)
```

Here's what one looks like:

## "Open" and Bad Data Examples

We offer two sets of squares inspired by the ~~pain~~ joy of dealing with [`#otherpeoplesdata`](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23otherpeoplesdata&src=tyah)

Use `topics[["open-data"]]` to get squares based on this tweet from Chris McDowall:

> For two weeks I noted issues encountered as I used NZ govt data. Today I collected enough to make a bingo card. *[\@fogonwater, January 3, 2016](https://twitter.com/fogonwater/status/683785398112260097)*

Use `topics[["bad-data"]]` to get squares inspired by the [Quartz guide to bad data](https://github.com/Quartz/bad-data-guide):

> An exhaustive reference to problems seen in real-world data along with suggestions on how to resolve them.... Most of these problems can be solved. Some of them can't be solved and that means you should not use the data. Others can't be solved, but with precautions you can continue using the data.

```{r}
## see some Open Data squares
tail(topics[["open-data"]])

## see some Bad Data squares
tail(topics[["bad-data"]])

## make a single Open Data bingo card
bc <- bingo(words = topics[["open-data"]])

## make a custom bingo blend from the open and bad data squares
bc <- bingo(words = c(topics[["open-data"]], topics[["bad-data"]]))

## print it
plot(bc, pdf_base = "open-data-")
```

Here's an Open Data bingo card:

![](img/bingo-01-open-data.png)

```{r clean-up, include = FALSE}
crap <- c(list.files(pattern = "bingo-[0-9]+.pdf"),
          list.files(pattern = "open-data-[0-9]+.pdf"))
file.remove(crap)
```

## Run Shiny app locally

To run [the app we're running remotely](http://daattali.com/shiny/bingo/) on your own machine, do this:

```{r eval = FALSE}
launch()
```
